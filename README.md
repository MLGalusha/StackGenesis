Welcome to StackGenesis, the first step in my full-stack development journey. This project aims to create a simple web application with a Python backend and a frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I want the website to be able to interact with a simple python program. Instead of having
to interact with the program through the terminal I want something good looking. At this point I know nothing about full stack and I'm a begginner in python. Lets see how this goes!
